## Features

- Two-player mode: Play with a friend on the same machine.
- Simple and intuitive user interface using the console.
- Input validation to ensure valid moves.
- Displays the game board after each move.
- Detects and announces the winner or a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game:** When you run the program, the game board will be displayed. The board consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered positions from 1 to 9.
2. **Players take turns:** Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'. Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the position where they want to place their symbol.
3. **Winning the game:** The game continues until one player aligns three of their symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
4. **End of the game:** The game announces the winner or declares a draw once the game is complete.
